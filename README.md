# ProbabilityCalculator
System that carries out sampling of draws out of a hat to determine the probability of a given event occurring.



A hat contains several balls; there may be several different colours for the balls. If I were to ask you how likely it is that you draw at least 2 green balls and 5 red balls, you could use sampling to estimate how likely this is. Of course, the more times you sample, the more accurate the answer becomes.



This was created for the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python course.
